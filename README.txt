IMPORTANT: To run the game simulation, Please run the Main class in the View Package (View.Main)

IMPORTANT: In the Model, almost all the methods are implemented (Alot of methods are in the Game class).
Important to note: We did not include all the methods in the Main class (Game simulation) although we have implemented
alot of them.

- All the tests in the ClassTests class (in the Tests package) are tested with a different board
           than the one currently set in the Game class, for correct results (for the J unit tests methods),
           please change the board 2d array in the game class to the one shown in the comments in the ClassTests.
