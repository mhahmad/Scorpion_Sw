*:Not all methods in .Model are implemented in GUI (Such as Killstreak and colored tiles functionality),
  Other than that, Almost everything in the game screen (gameboardScreen) works, like queen movements and such.
*: Question Managament screen works as intended (Read and write to Json files), as well as leaderBoard screen (
   After a game finishes, it gets added to the leaderboard screen.).

Note: Hamka.Jar is included, as well as the scrum_Backlog, and the class diagram was update from itration 1.
